# CD45er: Estimation of CD45 isoform expression from 5' 10x single-cell RNA sequencing data

CD45er is a tool to estimate the frequencies of different CD45 isoforms in 5' 10x data. See example/ for sample code running the tool on a publicly available 10x dataset, and comparing the results to those obtained by protein-level feature barcoding.
